C++11 move semantics
====================

The goal of this exercise is to investigate how to implement move
operations for a class and figure out its impact on the code.

Steps
-----

1. Set up your environment::

     . /storage/software/env-gcc472.sh

2. Go to the exercise directory::

     cd esc/exercises/c++

3. Review exercise code, making sure you understand everything that is being done:
    * `big.hxx <../exercises/c++/big.hxx>`_
    * `big.cxx <../exercises/c++/big.cxx>`_
    * `big-main.cxx <../exercises/c++/big-main.cxx>`_

4. Compile and run ``big-main`` ::

     $ make -f big-Makefile

5. Note the number of ``Big`` instances being created and copied.
   You can also look at the assembly like so::

     $ objdump -S -r ./big-main | c++filt | less

6. Now, implement the move operations (i.e. the move constructor and
   the move assignmenent operator)

7. Compile and run ``big-main``, compare with the number of ``Big``
   instances being created "from scratch".
