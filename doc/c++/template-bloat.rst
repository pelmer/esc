Templates and Template Bloat
============================

The goal of this exercise is to demonstrate templates and the size of code
generated by the templates once compiled.

1. Inspect the templates.cxx file below

2. Make sure you understand everything that is being done

3. Compile with and without the "DIFFERENT" macro defined and compile with
   different optimization levels (-O0 to -O3)

4. Compare the size of the results

5. Compare with the -save-temps switch (which stores the usual "temporary"
   intermedate files permanently) the largest and the leanest programs from
   above

6. Look at the assembly code and try to figure out if everything makes sense

7. Copy the templates.cxx file (to explicit-templates-inst.cxx, say) and edit
   the new file to use explicit template instantiation

8. Compare the code size resulting from compilation of each of templates.cxx
   and explicit-templates-inst.cxx
