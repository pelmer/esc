String memory use
=================

The goal of this exercise is to understand the memory use and performance of
`std::string <http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/string/string/>`_. You will
get familiar with the `IgProf <http://igprof.sourceforge.net>`_ profiler tool.

Steps
-----

1. Set up your environment::

     . /storage/software/env-gcc472.sh

2. Go to the exercise directory::

     cd esc/exercises/memory

3. Examine the little test programs in this directory.  You use them for
   dedicated little studies on container memory allocation behaviour:

   - `ls-build.cc <../exercises/memory/ls-build.cc>`_: Build a
     ``std::list<std::string>`` one at a time.

   - `vs-build.cc <../exercises/memory/vs-build.cc>`_: Build a
     ``std::vector<std::string>`` one at a time.

   - `vvs-build-and-copy.cc <../exercises/memory/vvs-build-and-copy.cc>`_:
     Same as ``vvvi-build-and-copy.cc``, but using doubly nested vector of
     strings.  Behaves differently because strings are copy-on-write -- less
     memory copies but more reference counting.

4. Build each program.  The command is mentioned in each source file.  To
   build all in one go::

     grep -h Compile *.cc | sed 's|// Compile: ||' | sh -x

5. Run the programs under the igprof profiler::

     rm -f *.gz
     igprof -mp ./ls-build
     igprof -mp ./vs-build
     igprof -mp ./vvs-build-and-copy

6. Analyse the profiles using::

     for f in *.gz; do
       igprof-analyse --sqlite -d -v -g -r MEM_TOTAL $f |
         sqlite3 ~/public_html/cgi-bin/data/${f}_tot.sql3
       igprof-analyse --sqlite -d -v -g -r MEM_LIVE $f |
         sqlite3 ~/public_html/cgi-bin/data/${f}_live.sql3
       igprof-analyse --sqlite -d -v -g -r MEM_LIVE --value peak $f |
         sqlite3 ~/public_html/cgi-bin/data/${f}_live_peak.sql3
     done

7. This results in profiles such as
   http://137.204.203.67/~stud01/cgi-bin/igprof-navigator.py/vvs-copy.gz_tot/
